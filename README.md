smart sanitka ->To alert the hospitals before they are arriving. It makes the surgeons to ready with their proper necessary arrangements in advance. ->By checking the bed availablity in hospital in advance we can chose the hospital wisely and patiently. -> By our project we can inform the traffic control room in advance to make the traffic clear in the way to the hospital.
